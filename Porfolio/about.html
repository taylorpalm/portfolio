                <h1>Hey there!</h1>
                <p>I'm Taylor Palm, a registered dietitian turned software developer. No you're right,
                    they have nothing to do with eachother. I got my bachelor's in nutrition, master's in 
                    nutrition, became an RD and when it was all said and done, I realized I wanted to be
                    a computer programmer.
                </p>

                <p>I love puzzles. I've been known to sit at a puzzle for hours 
                        until I can barely see straight. I like to break things into pieces, figure out how
                        they fit and that's where I fell in love with computer science. I went back to school shortly thereafter to complete a post-bacc in computer science at Stockton
                    University and now I'm a few short months from graduation, eager to get into the field
                    and start solving the world's biggest problems with code.
                </p>

                <p>Aside from geeking out on computer things, my other hobbies include working out, reading restaurant menus, and
                    buying plane tickets on a whim. I've been to 17 countries and counting(that pic to the left is Thailand), eaten
                    all the weird foods abroad- bugs, chicken intestines, cow penis- you name it. I've ziplined in Costa Rica,
                    drank steins at Oktoberfest, snorkled the Great Barrier Reef and loved every second. Well, that's enough about me for an "About Me."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thanks for visiting my portfolio!  
                </p>
